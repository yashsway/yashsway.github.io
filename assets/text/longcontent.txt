::txt-exp::I had wonderful opportunities to work at a couple of different companies in the past few years. So far, I've worked in the retail, healthcare and the service/educational industries and I have learnt quite a bit in each which I'm very thankful for. You can learn more about my responsibilities at each position through my LinkedIn or my resume.</br></br>Apart from my professional work experience, I also try to get involved in other things that excite me: ::
::txt-exp::</br>&gt; I'm an active member of HackItMac, a student-run group at McMaster that is reinvigorating the school's tech scene. They've held two hackathons called 'DeltaHacks' so far and without them our tech community would not be on the map. Currently, I'm working with them to open up a new Hardware Lab on campus that would house Raspberry PI's, Arduinos, Myo Band's, circuitry and other goodies for students to experiment with. I also have plans to setup a HackItMac student portal where we can centralize all of its activities. It's still an idea at the moment.::
::txt-exp::</br>&gt; I'm working with the McMaster Hyperloop team currently with their branding & marketing. I designed their logo and I'm drafting mockups for their website at the moment.::
::txt-exp::</br>&gt; I used to be the Promotions team Exec at the Software Engineering Club. I did some design work for them but handed off the reigns as I had to focus more on school and intramurals.::
::txt-exp::</br>&gt; In May 2014, I attended the Spectrum Startup Competition where I networked with complete strangers and put together a team of four creative individuals. We came up with a business plan and product called 'Beaver'. We presented to a panel of 5 experienced industry professionals.::
::txt-exp::</br>&gt; I love hackathons! I've participated in three hackathons so far: Hack the North at Waterloo, YHack at Yale and DeltaHacks right here on campus. I pack my trusty duffel bag with clothes and food, my backpack with my laptop and other tech supplies and a very uncomfortable sleeping bag that always becomes my most prized posession after 12 hours. I've worked with many creative people like Surinder Gill, John Peng and some of my closest friends, Vicky Bilbilly and Jemar Jones.::
