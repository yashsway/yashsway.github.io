I had wonderful opportunities to work at a couple of different companies in the past few years. So far, I've worked in the retail, healthcare and the service/educational industries and I have learnt quite a bit in each. You can learn more about my responsibilities at each position through my LinkedIn or my resume.
</br></br>Apart from my professional work experience, I also try to get involved in other things, on & off campus.
</br></br>I'm an active member of HackItMac, a student-run group at McMaster that is reinvigorating the school's tech scene. They've held two hackathons called 'DeltaHacks' so far and without them our tech community would not be on the map. Currently, I'm working with them to open up a new Hardware Lab on campus that would house Raspberry PI's, Arduinos, Myo Band's, circuitry and other goodies for students to experiment with. I also have plans to setup a HackItMac student portal where we can centralize all of its activities. It's still an idea at the moment.
